Mount for attaching NO-wired limit switches flush to the surface of a 2020 extrusion. Handy for custom gantries.
# Limit Switch Mount for 2020 Aluminum Extrusion

The limit switch is directly fit into the little slot, as shown in the picture. Once screwed in to the extrusion, it should sit tightly between the extrusion and the mount.

The hole is sized for M5 screws. An M5 x 10 screw should be long enough to mount it to an extrusion.

It is also possible to attach the limit switch flush to a 2040 extrusion by cutting away the “legs” on one side of the mount.
