Another Hackathon Project

This was a hackathon submission for Ocean Protocol's Data Economy Challenge 2020. It's a little chrome extension that let's you browse, upload, and set notifications on things in the Ocean Data Marketplace.

Jeremy and I wanted to challenge ourselves by diving into something we knew very little about, and this idea was further expanded upon with [Hark](/hark-tv-a-retrospective)

This is also the second hackathon of the triple hackathon streak Jeremy and I went on: [Node Visualizer](/node-visualizer) -> [MoonJelly](/moon-jelly-chrome-extension) -> [HarkTV](/hark-tv-a-retrospective).
