Low effort project completed during a week
# Screwdriver Box
I saw this [Gridfinity Rugged Box](https://github.com/smkent/monoscad/tree/main/gridfinity/rugged-box) design and it got me wanting some self-contained organizer boxes.

I ended up using this variant on the original. All parts were printed in PLA, and it came out sturdy.

Before I even really knew what I wanted to put in the box, I started printing out a 3x4x6U box. It was a long print with multiple components, so I started thinking about what I wanted to put in it as it printed. My precision screwdriver set and some related tools seemed like a good candidate, so I went with it.

I really didn't want to spend the time making custom models for each thing I was going to store, so I took the shortcut of "good enough" boxes with [Perplexing Lab's Gridfinity Generator web tool](https://gridfinity.perplexinglabs.com/pr/gridfinity-rebuilt/0/0). There's quite a few options, like adding slopes and holes to the boxes. It got the job done.

The screw bit holder didn't turn out that well. I tried to use a soldering iron to make the bit holder holes a little wider but it generated a lot of plastic fumes without meaningfully improving the fit of the holes, even though they were a little bigger.

The original design for the bit-holder was bad anyway since it would have been a pain removing the bits from these holes. So I kept the bits in their original holders and used the piece as a normal container (with a few burn marks).
