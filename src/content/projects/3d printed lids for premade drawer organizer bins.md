3D printed lids for drawer organizer bins I don't use
# Custom lids for premade bins

I have this 60-pack of drawer organizer bins I bought on Amazon that I haven't made great use of. Now that I also have a 3D printer, the use of these bins has declined even more since I can just 3D print custom and tailor-fit drawer organizers.

I didn't want these organizer bins to go completely to waste, so I came up with a new use for them: lidded containers!

Several iterations later, this is what I came up with:

Sorry, let's get those prototypes out of the way:

They work pretty well!
