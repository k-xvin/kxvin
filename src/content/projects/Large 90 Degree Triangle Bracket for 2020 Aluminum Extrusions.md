Meant as both a structural element and connector.
# Large 90 Degree Triangle Bracket for 2020 Aluminum Extrusions

This is a large triangle bracket for fitting two 2020 aluminum extrusions together at a 90 degree angle. The size of it should help keep two extrusions in a stable 90 degree position. It is more a structural element than a standalone connector.

I recommend printing it on its side with supports enabled so the holes don't become as warped. Printing it on its side also ensures the bracket is less likely to snap along the layer lines.
