3D printed replacement part for my dad

# Replacement Sight Blade

This is a niche part for the MP-28 II, a firearm used in WWII that is no longer in production. Specifically, it is the front sight. It's a complex shape, with many subtle curves and details. The most important detail, as my dad highlight to me, is that one end of the bottom is ever-so-slightly narrower than the other side, which allows it slide in to place and be friction-fit on the gun. Its specificity, odd shape, and rarity makes it the perfect problem for 3D printing to solve.

I used a digital caliper to make the measurements, and made good use of the loft tool in order to capture the shape of the sight. The upper portion of the model is not as accurate as it could be, but the bottom profile is pretty close to the real thing. I printed the model with 0.12mm layers to try and preserve the measurement details.

Model is public on [OnShape](https://cad.onshape.com/documents/59133791f4f274020ef7bd54/w/0a5394a7dd48ed6bcf3af651/e/0c3081bcaa59c61ee4ddec0a).
