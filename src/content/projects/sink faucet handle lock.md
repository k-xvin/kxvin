Device to limit the movement of a faucet's handles
# Partial Faucet Handle Lock
# Problem
I needed a way to modify a faucet so it could only be partially turned on (and adjusting the plumbing valves for the faucet was not feasible). Thus, I needed something to block the handles of the sink from being fully turned. Since I recently got a 3D printer, I was pretty sure I could cobble something together.
# Inspiration
I started by looking around online for inspiration. The below designs fully lock the sink by preventing the handles from being turned, but I needed one that would allow the handle to be partially turned.
* [Offset Bathroom Sink Faucet Handle Childproof Lock]( https://www.etsy.com/listing/1745851573/offset-bathroom-sink-faucet-handle?gpla=1&gao=1&&utm_custom1=_k_{gclid}_k_&utm_custom2=21500568363&gad_source=5)

# Result
I ran through a couple of designs, but I settled on this one I initially prototyped with some paper tubes. I took the pin-and-hole locking mechanism from some of the inspiration above.

After 3D printing out the model, I had to manually cut out and widen the holes for the handles with a knife, which was a bit of pain. Then the lock fit nice and snug onto the sink.

You can find the model free to use and modify [here on Onshape](https://cad.onshape.com/documents/d7fbc3ecdc0e4c937e4aec08/w/fc5eb2d9331b97c98b26b8fe/e/3a3d29e7931acd714c2ee5f8?renderMode=0&uiState=67cc9e0bc003663fc706062d). It's been updated with the wider holes I had to manually cut out.

I made the gif below using [LICEcap](https://www.cockos.com/licecap/). Open source and easy to use! Passed it through https://ezgif.com/ afterwards to reduce the size.
