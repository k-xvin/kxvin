A Hackathon Project

This project was a submission for [monday.com's Apps Marketplace Challenge 2020](https://mondayapps.devpost.com/). It's a little add-on that let's you view and edit a project board as a node graph.

This is also the first hackathon of the triple hackathon streak Jeremy and I went on: [Node Visualizer](/node-visualizer) -> [MoonJelly](/moon-jelly-chrome-extension) -> [HarkTV](/hark-tv-a-retrospective).

- The best part of this project was this cool video we made for it.
