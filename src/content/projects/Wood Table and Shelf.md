Wood table and shelf combo for my room

# Wood Table and Shelf

![table_finish_outside.jpeg](/content/attachments/table_finish_outside.jpeg)

I made a wooden table with a built in shelf to put in my room. I made a CAD for it but I ended up winging half of it since my original design seemed a little to unstable. It ended up still being kind of a rickety table, but it gets the job done.

I used scrap wood that has been lying in my garage for years, and I put a coat of danish oil on it at the end.
