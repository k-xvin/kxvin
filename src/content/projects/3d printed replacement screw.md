3D printed replacement screw part for my dad’s friend

# Replacement Screw
I modeled and printed a replacement screw part for my dad’s friend. The model is public on [Onshape](https://cad.onshape.com/documents/60db738494b69c4d74f34c29/w/639ef89afbe6d6a6d9e70251/e/c5aa0ca985d870164e13517e).

I’m not really sure what the part is for or why an extra one is needed (maybe I got a little bit [nerd sniped](https://xkcd.com/356)) but it was a fun opportunity to hone my CAD skills and help someone out. I also got to see how the printer fares for details like screw threads.

The print is a little rough and the CAD model itself could be polished up, but I think it turned out well. I directly modeled the screw threads, since this was before I found [this handy ThreadCreator plugin](https://cad.onshape.com/documents/6b640a407d78066bd5e41c7a/v/21ef017a4e386179c3be31f3/e/c953720c264ce001f1a82dc1).

# Part 2
My dad’s friend liked the first screw so much he wanted two more! The screw threads fit well, but he wanted some more precise replicas that matched the top of the screw (even if it made the model a little weaker due to the overhang and narrower neck). It was a simple addition to the existing model.

Since the top now had overhangs, I added some supports to the print. It was my first time using supports, and I was surprised at how well they separated from the main model.
