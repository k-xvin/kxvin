A game I made in high school in my programming class

# RECT

RECT is a top-down roguelike adventure game focused on item synergies and bullet-hell-esque combat. It's
pretty much just a clone of
[The Binding of Isaac: Rebirth](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Binding_of_Isaac:_Rebirth).

The game is written in Java and it was made in a team of 3 in my AP Computer Science class, as a final project.

I've made the source code [available here](https://github.com/k-xvin/RECT), alongside some packaged .jar files of the game. It might be a little hard to get running, as it requires the JavaFX library, which isn't packaged with most Java runtimes past Java 8.

# What's in this thing

- Randomly generated rooms of enemies
    - However, there is no persistent layout of rooms for each floor/level. You walk into a new room, and the old room is gone.
- Several types of enemies with different attack patterns and behaviors
- 2 unique bosses
- 15 unique items that can synergize with each other
