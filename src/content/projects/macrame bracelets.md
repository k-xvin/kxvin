some cool bracelets I made

# Macrame Bracelets

I made these macrame bracelets following the tutorial below. Despite looking intricate, the process was straightforward and enjoyable. I found it similar to origami.

I also thought thinking of making a pair of macrame watch straps in the future, but the knot/threadwork seems more complicated.
